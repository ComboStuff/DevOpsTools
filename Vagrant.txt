provides VM.
Single command line program using a single file format to build, run, and manage any VM 
HashiCorp publish and share its products 
primary purpose - create custom isolated development environments. 
components - the CLI(Commad Line tool), Vagrantfiles(coded in ruby), and Vagrant Cloud(Market place of all VM).

feature of Vagrant:
	connect to Vagrant VM
	folder sync
	multipule networking
	provide plugins 
	provisions installing software and setting configurations.
	multi machine Vagrantfiles

running Vagrant:
	vagrant init  - creates Vagrantfile with config as "base"
	vagrant init <boxname> creates Vagrantfile with config as "boxname"
	boxname="orginastioname/distubution and version"
	vagrant up -creates the VM and loads it to the Virtualbox defaultly

vagrant commands:
	vagrant status(used in the same directory)
	vagrant global-status(can access from any where)
	vagrant hault id
	vagrant ssh -connect the terminal of the VM
	vagrant destory -delete all the resourses 
	vagrant reload -restarts the box

vagrant cloud:
	app.vagrantup.com-url to the vagrant cloud

Vagrantfile:
	syncing:
		config.vm.synced_folder "../<foldername>", "/vagrant_data"
		networking:
		config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080 -less secure than the below
		and 	
		config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1" -used to forward the port connect to the localhost
		config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10",type="dhcp"  - used to use private network ie host only accessable

	graphics:
    	vb.gui="true" gives graphical user interface

	provisions:
   		config.vm.provision "shell", path: "filepath"  used to run shell scripts 
		memory:
		vb.memory = "1024"   memorysize
		vb.cpus="2"		number of cpus

	vagrant provider:
		vmstat -s - memory allocation 
		lscpu - Virtualcpus
