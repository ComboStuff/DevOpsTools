Intro:
	devops=developement + operations
	devops is not a tool it is a culture
	came from agile
	prioritize speed and stability
	In devOps structure when an dev commits a code, automatic build and testing will start and qa will be able to test the code
	when there is an error in the product the automated monitoring notifies the team about the error

goals:
	1.Fast time to market
	2.few failures
	3.immediate recovery from failure

Build automation:
	fast,consistent,portable,repeatable,reliable
	The automation of the process of preparing code for deployment to a live environment 

	continuous integration:
	continuous small merges in the code

	continuous delivery:
	Means always maintaining the code in deployable state

	continuous deployment:
	deploying small changes to the production

Infrastructure as code:
	manage and provide infrastructure using code and automation

	config mgmt:
		maintaining and changing pieces of infrastructure in a stable,consistent and maintainable way

	orchestration:
		automation supporting processes and workflows

	monitoring :
		collection and presentation of data about performance and stability of services and infrastructure

	microservices:
		breaks an application into a small collection of loosely coupled services
